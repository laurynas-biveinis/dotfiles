;;; Commentary:

;; This library helps parse data in monotone's basic_io format.
;;
;; See docstrings for details.

;;; Code:

;;; There are some notes on the design of xmtn in
;;; docs/xmtn-readme.txt.

;;; I haven't seen a specification for monotone's basic_io format.
;;; I'm implementing this parser somewhat defensively.

;;; Maybe strings in basic_io are always encoded as UTF-8?  In that
;;; case, the decoding code for filenames and cert names/values that
;;; is currently spread across several functions could be moved
;;; directly in here.

;;; `parse-partial-sexp'/`scan-sexps', with an appropriate syntax
;;; table, looks like the best way to do this kind of parsing.  It is
;;; very likely faster than anything we can implement by hand in Emacs
;;; Lisp.

;;; Much of the code in here has been tuned for speed quite a bit.
;;; Careful with refactorings!  For example, introducing a variable
;;; binding that the byte-compiler can't optimize away can mean a
;;; major slowdown.

;;; Using cons cells instead of two-element lists is only a very minor
;;; performance advantage (<.5%).  Also, with cons cells, `null-id'
;;; would have to be a bare symbol, while `id' and `string' would be
;;; cons cells; with lists, the representation is more uniform.

BUFFER-FORM should evaluate to a buffer that contains, between

BODY will be evaluated with LINE-PARSER \(a symbol\) bound to a
closure that will, each time it is called, return the next line
in parsed form, or the symbol `eof' if there are no more lines.

Empty lines are returned as the symbol `empty'.

Each non-empty line is a list of a key and zero or more fields.
The key is a string.  Each field is either a one-element list
\(null-id\) and represents an empty ID field \(what monotone
prints as \[\] in basic_io format\), a two-element list \(id
HASH-ID\), where HASH-ID is a string of forty hexadecimal digits
\(what monotone prints as \[HASH-ID\]\), or a two-element list
\(string STRING\), where STRING is a string (what monotone prints
as \"STRING\"\).

Lines and their contents are always fresh objects.

The macro `xmtn-match' is a useful way to process basic_io lines
parsed this way.

The parser should be assumed to have dynamic extent.  If the
