  "List of (type name mode) used to generate a name for a buffer.

TYPE is the type of buffer to create, passed as the first argument to
`dvc-get-buffer-create'.

NAME is a string, used as a name for the returned buffer.

MODE is a symbol defining the way to manage (value of
`default-directory' in the created buffer) paths for this type of
buffers. It can have the following values:

 * 'root: `default-directory' will be the tree-root of the specified
   directory.

 * 'path: `default-directory' will be the path specified. Can also be
   a file.

For 'root and 'path, `dvc-get-buffer-create' will return the existing
buffer for this type and this path if it exists, or create a new one
otherwise.

 * 'single: There is only one buffer of this type for each Emacs
   instance. If a path is provided, `default-directory' is set to that
   path. Otherwise, the path is left unchanged when a buffer is
   reused, and set to the current directory on buffer creation.

 * 'multiple: `default-directory' is set to the path specified. A new
   buffer is returned anyway. (No buffer reuse).

 * 'string: The path specified is actually a string. It won't be used
   to set `default-directory'. The name of the created buffer will be
   (format name string).

 * 'string-multiple: combination of 'string and 'multiple.")
