Current directory for the process is the current `default-directory'.
ARGUMENTS is a list of arguments.  nil values in this list are removed.
KEYS is a list of keywords and values.  Possible keywords are:

 :finished ....... Function run when the process finishes.  If none
                   specified, `dvc-default-finish-function' is run.

 :killed ......... Function run when the process is killed.  If none
                   specified, `dvc-default-killed-function' is run.

 :error .......... Function run when the process exits with a non 0
                   status.  If none specified,
                   `dvc-default-error-function' is run.

All these functions take 4 arguments : output, error, status, and
arguments.

   - \"output\" is the output buffer
   - \"error\" is the buffer where standard error is redirected
   - \"status\" is the numeric exit-status or the signal number
   - \"arguments\" is the list of arguments, as a list of strings,
              like '(\"changes\" \"--diffs\")

   `dvc-null-handler' can be used here if there's nothing to do.

 :filter           Function to call every time we receive output from
                   the process.  It should take arguments proc and string.
                   The string will have been run through
                   `dvc-process-filter' to deal with password prompts and
                   newlines.

 :output-buffer .. Buffer where the output of the process should be
                   redirected.  If none specified, a new one is
                   created, and will be entered in
                   `dvc-dead-process-buffer-queue' to be killed
                   later.

 :error-buffer ... Buffer where the standard error of the process
                   should be redirected.

 :related-buffer . Defaults to `current-buffer'.  This is the buffer
                   where the result of the process will be used.  If
                   this buffer is killed before the end of the
                   execution, the user is prompted if he wants to kill
                   the process."
