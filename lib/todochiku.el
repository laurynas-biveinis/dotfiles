;;; Commentary:
;; todochiku is **NOTHING** in japanese.   todoroku "growl" in Japanese.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `todochiku-in'
;;    Send a todochiku message in a set ammount of time. Can take a prefix arg for the number of mins to wait.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `todochiku-command'
;;    Path to command for sending growl-like messages.
;;    default = (case system-type (windows-nt "C:/Program Files/full phat/Snarl/exrras/sncmd/snarl_command.exe") (darwin "/usr/local/bin/growlnotify") (t "notify-send"))
;;  `todochiku-message-too'
;;    Display todochiku as messages as well
;;    default = nil
;;  `todochiku-tooltip-too'
;;    Display todochiku as a tooltip.
;;    default = nil
;;  `todochiku-icons-directory'
;;    Path to the todochiku icons directory.
;;    default = "~/.emacs-cfg/todochiku-icons"
;;  `todochiku-timeout'
;;    Time to display a todochiku notification (not used by all backends)
;;    default = 10
;;  `todochiku-icons'
;;    An alist containing an icon name, and a path to the icon.
;;    default = (quote ((default . "announcements.png") (alert . "alert.png") (bell . "bell.png") (compile . "binary.png") (irc . "chat.png") ...))
;;  `todochiku-compile-message'
;;    Automatically add a hook to send a todochiku on compilation finsih.
;;    default = (quote t)
;;  `todochiku-appts'
;;    Install todochiku as the apt-disp-window-function.
;;    default = (quote t)
;;  `todochiku-display-appts-in-window-too'
;;    Whether or not pings from apt-disp-window should show up in emacs as well as growl.
;;    default = (quote t)

;; This is more a smaller library package to start with.  Maybe it will grow one day.

;; Installation:
;; Make sure you have snarl/growl/libnotify installed, and load this file from your .Emacs
;; i.e. (load-file "~/.emacs-cfg/todochiku.el")
;;
;; If you have an external notification program, you can use that. 
;; use customize-group todochiku, and make sure you set the todochiku-command.
;;
;; If you do not have an external notification program, there is basic support
;; for similar notifications using the message window and/or tooltips.
;; See todochiku-message-too and todochiku-tooltip-too.
; 
;; For icon support, customize the todochiku-icons-directory variable.  I have
;; a directory of png icons available at
;; http://bunny.jonnay.net/todochiku-icons.tar.gz
;; In the future, the downloading and installing of this directory will be
;; automagickal.

;; interactive commands: 
;; todochiku-in - do a todochiku.  This is a great way to set up a reminder
;;                for yourself.

;; elisp:
;; If you want to send a growl message from elisp, just use the function
;; todochiku-message

;;; TODO:
;; - maybe look at advising the message function? that might be super dumb.
;;   if done, the value of todochiku-message-too NEEDS to be looked at,
;;   so that an infinite loop doesn't occur.
;; - Update the icon support.  Automagickally download and install the icons
;;   with the url package.
;; - Build better backend support.

;;; CHANGELOG:
;; V0.0.8 - Fixed broken `todochiku-icons-directory' definition that made it impossible to change through Customize.
;; V0.0.7b - Added support for sticky messages for libnotify and growl.
;; V0.0.7  - Added YaOddMuse interface
;; V0.0.6.1 - Bugfixing fom Jason McBrayer  (thanks!)
;; V0.0.6 - Added patches from Jason McBrayer for *nix notifications.
;; V0.0.5 - Added Initial support for emacs only notification
;;        - Added variables to the customization group.
;;        - Added some better documentation.
;; V0.0.4 - Added initial icon support.  Right now it kinds sucks
;;          Becuase it takes too much configuration.
;;        - Fixed the comment about todochiku being growl in
;;          japanese.  Doh.  I coulda sworn the 'ro' was a 'chi'. 
;; v0.0.3 - Added growl.el interface
;;        - Added rcirc notify when you are mentioned in IRC (from Brian Templetons growl.el)
;; v0.0.2 - fixed to use growl properly
;;        - set the debug constent to false (duh)
;;        - added some system checks around command and arguments
;;        - 
;; v0.0.1 - first release
;;
;;; BUGS:
;; - For some reason my face isn't working properly
