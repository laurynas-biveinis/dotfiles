;;; my-edit.el --- Emacs editing configuration.  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; Configure Emacs editing features, including indentation, kill & yank, undo.
;; Depends on `major-mode-remap-alist' being already configured.
;;
;; Like in the rest of my personal configuration, all features (packages and
;; external tools) are assumed to exist, because this is a part of my dotfiles
;; repo where the needed packages are committed too. Thus, no error handling,
;; and no need to ensure compatibility with different Emacs or package versions.
;;
;; Custom keybindings:
;; <f6> - edit all occurrences of a symbol

;;; Code:

;;; Variables and functions defined elsewhere we'll be using
;; Defined in secrets.el: a list of strings of file names for which `undo-tree'
;; should be disabled.
