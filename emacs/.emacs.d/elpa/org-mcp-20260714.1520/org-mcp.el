  "Cross-cutting behavior shared by org-mcp's tools and resources.

File-modifying tools (org-add-todo, org-update-todo-state,
org-edit-headline, org-edit-body, org-refile-headline) modify the
file on disk; they fail if an Emacs buffer visiting the file has
unsaved changes; ask the user to save the buffer and retry.  They
validate the file's leading header block on every call; any `:NAME:'
line at column 0 (with optional leading whitespace and any keyword) is
treated as a drawer opener and must have a matching `:END:'.  An
unterminated drawer, or a drawer containing a heading, is rejected as
a validation error.  A `#+BEGIN_NAME' opener with no matching
`#+END_NAME', or a `#+BEGIN:' dynamic block with no matching `#+END:',
is rejected too.

org-archive-subtree and org-refile-headline likewise modify files on
disk and fail on unsaved changes, but can write two files --
org-archive-subtree the source and the destination archive file,
org-refile-headline the source and (for a cross-file move) the target
file -- so a buffer visiting either one with unsaved changes blocks the
operation; ask the user to save and retry.

Read tools (org-read-file, org-read-outline, org-read-headline,
org-read-by-id, org-grep, org-find-tagged-ancestor) and all resources
read the file from disk; unsaved changes in an Emacs buffer visiting
the file are not reflected.

org-read-headline, org-read-by-id, and the corresponding
org-headline:// (with a headline path) and org-id:// resources return
a JSON object of `headline_path' (the ancestor chain from the
outermost ancestor down to the read headline itself, in the same node
shape as org-grep's `headline_path') and `content' (the raw subtree
text); whole-file org-headline:// reads return raw file content."

tool and resource description.")

`://', nil otherwise.  A bare prefix URI (e.g. `org-id://') or one
whose suffix is only blank characters cannot identify a resource;
a doubly-prefixed URI like `org-id://org-headline://foo' indicates
a malformed input rather than an ID lookup.  Returning nil for
both cases makes the dispatch helpers classify them as malformed
URIs at the validation boundary instead of dispatching a
no-meaningful-content lookup downstream."

header.  A heading that renders on several lines of one block (a
multi-day span entry, a repeated deadline warning) is emitted once:
item nodes are deduplicated within a block by their source-heading
identity (the `org-hd-marker' buffer and position), since the bare node
carries no per-line date to tell the copies apart.  Deduping on
identity rather than `uri' keeps two distinct headings that share a
title path (and thus an `org-headline://' URI) from collapsing.  Lines

agenda buffer name so the user window layout is not disturbed.
Building the agenda mutates several global agenda bookkeeping variables
-- most damagingly it invalidates the markers of any live interactive
agenda via `org-agenda-reset-markers' -- so they are let-bound here,
which restores the user's values on exit and leaves a concurrent
interactive agenda intact.  `org-agenda-start-day' is bound to nil so
an omitted reference day anchors on today rather than the user's
global, and `org-agenda-contributing-files' is bound to nil so the
build does not overwrite the user's live value.  Any active agenda
restriction lock is neutralized for the build: `org-agenda-restrict'
and `org-agenda-overriding-restriction' are bound to nil, and the
`org-restrict' symbol property on `org-agenda-files' (which the agenda
honors above the dynamic variable) is cleared and restored, so the

OPERATION is a string describing the operation for error messages.

Validates FILE-PATH has no unsaved changes (errors via

FILE-PATH's contents in `org-mode', `set-visited-file-name' pointing
at FILE-PATH, and point at `point-min', and runs BODY there.  Unlike
`org-mcp--with-org-file', the buffer visits FILE-PATH so BODY may save
it, and the unsaved-change guard runs first.

The visiting buffer's modified flag is cleared before `with-temp-buffer'
kills it.  Setup (`set-visited-file-name' then `insert-file-contents',
no VISIT arg) leaves the buffer modified before BODY runs, and BODY's own
save (`write-region', no VISIT arg) does not clear it, so it is modified
whenever `with-temp-buffer' kills it.  Killing a modified file-visiting
buffer makes a live Emacs pop `Buffer FILE<2> modified; kill anyway?'.
The `FILE<2>' name arises because the buffer `set-visited-file-name' creates
collides with any buffer the user already has visiting FILE-PATH.  The
`unwind-protect' spans setup and BODY, so the flag is cleared however the
macro exits -- normal return, or a signal from setup or BODY alike -- and
the teardown kill is silent."

Macro behaviour:
- Validates FILE-PATH has no unsaved changes (errors via

- Sets up a temp buffer with FILE-PATH's contents in `org-mode',
  with `set-visited-file-name' pointing at FILE-PATH and point at
  `point-min'.
- Executes BODY in that buffer.
- After BODY returns, calls `org-mcp--complete-and-save' which
  ensures the entry containing point has an Org ID (creating one
  if needed), writes the buffer to FILE-PATH, refreshes any
  visiting Emacs buffer, and returns JSON with the entry's
  `org-id://' URI.

BODY contract:
- Must NOT call `org-mcp--complete-and-save' itself; the macro
  appends it after BODY.  Calling it inside BODY would write the
  file twice and return a stale JSON shape.
- Must leave point at or within the entry whose `org-id://' URI
  should be returned to the caller.
- BODY's return value is discarded; the macro's return value is
  the JSON from `org-mcp--complete-and-save'.
- Errors signalled in BODY propagate up unmodified (no rollback)."

lookups for the same ID hit the DB at O(1) instead of re-scanning;
this cache write is gated on `org-id-track-globally', so users who
have explicitly opted out of global ID tracking do not get implicit
DB mutations.  The cache write is performed best-effort -- any

Positioning behavior.  Five scenarios, selected by parent_uri shape
and the optional after_uri / position parameters:

  Child, end (default).
    Inputs: parent_uri with fragment (#PATH) or org-id://UUID; no
    after_uri; position omitted or \"end\".
    Effect: appended as the last child of the parent.

  Child, after sibling.
    Inputs: parent_uri + after_uri=org-id://UUID-of-sibling; no
    position.
    Effect: inserted as the immediate next sibling of after_uri's
    headline.

  Child, start.
    Inputs: parent_uri + position=\"start\"; no after_uri.
    Effect: inserted as the first child of the parent, after the
    parent's property drawer, planning line, logbook entries, and
    plain-text body -- i.e. just before the parent's first
    existing child heading.  When the parent has no children,
    `start' collapses to `end' at end-of-subtree.

  Top-level, end (default).
    Inputs: parent_uri with no fragment; no after_uri; position
    omitted or \"end\".
    Effect: appended at end of file.

  Top-level, start.
    Inputs: parent_uri (no fragment) + position=\"start\"; no
    after_uri.
    Effect: inserted before the first existing top-level heading
    but after the file's entire header block.  The header block
    is every leading line starting with `#' (including
    #+-prefixed keywords like #+TITLE:, file-local variable lines
    like `# -*- mode: org -*-', and Org comment lines), plus any
    :NAME:...:END: drawer in the leading run (:PROPERTIES:,
    :LOGBOOK:, and any custom drawer keyword are all consumed
    uniformly, even when Org's grammar would classify the drawer
    as a generic drawer rather than a file-level property drawer,
    to avoid silently reparenting it onto the new heading).  All
    header-class lines may have optional leading whitespace,
    matching Org's parser; headings themselves still require
    column 0.  When the file has no existing top-level heading
    (empty file, header-only, or zeroth-section content like a
    plain paragraph after the header), `start' collapses to `end'
    at point-max rather than inserting after the header block.
    This preserves any zeroth-section content in place instead of
    absorbing it into the new heading's body.

Combinations outside these five are rejected at the tool boundary.
After_uri cannot combine with an explicit position (which includes
position=\"end\", even though that is the default -- omit position
entirely to use after_uri-based placement), nor with a top-level
parent_uri (which has no sibling slot)."

     "Access content of a specific Org headline by its path in the
file hierarchy.  Returns the headline and all its subheadings, plus

URI format: org-headline://{filename}#{headline-path}
  filename - Absolute path (# characters must be encoded as %23)
  # - Fragment separator (literal #, not encoded)
  headline-path - URL-encoded headline titles separated by /

URI encoding rules:
  - File path # → %23 (e.g., file#1.org → file%231.org)
  - Fragment separator → # (literal, marks start of headline path)
  - Headline title spaces → %20
  - Headline title # → %23 (e.g., Task #5 → Task%20%2345)
  - Path separator → / (literal, between nested headlines)

Encoding limitations:
  - ONLY # is encoded in file paths (minimal encoding for readability)
  - File paths with % characters should be avoided
  - Files named with %XX patterns (e.g., \"100%23done.org\") will fail
  - For such files, rename them or use org-id:// URIs instead
  - Headline paths use full URL encoding (all special chars encoded)

ancestor chain in org-grep's node shape, from the outermost ancestor
to this headline itself) and content (the headline with TODO state,
tags, properties drawer, body text, and all nested subheadings).

Returns (no fragment): the entire file as plain text, not JSON.

Example URIs:
  org-headline:///home/user/tasks.org#Project%20Alpha

  org-headline:///home/user/tasks.org#Project%20Alpha/Planning

More stable than path-based access since IDs don't change when

URI format: org-id://{uuid}
  uuid - Value of the headline's ID property (required)

How IDs work in Org:
  Headlines can have an ID property:

    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

  The ID provides permanent, unique identification regardless of:
    - Headline title changes
    - Headline moving to different locations in file
    - File renaming or moving

Security and access:
  - The file containing the ID must be in org-mcp-allowed-files
  - Uses org-id database for ID-to-file lookup
  - Falls back to searching allowed files if database is stale

Returns: JSON object with headline_path (the ancestor chain in
org-grep's node shape, ending with this headline itself) and content
