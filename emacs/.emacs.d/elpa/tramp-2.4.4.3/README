Tramp stands for `Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple
Protocol'.  This package provides remote file editing, similar to
Ange-FTP.

The difference is that Ange-FTP uses FTP to transfer files between the
local and the remote host, whereas Tramp uses a combination of `rsh'
and `rcp' or other work-alike programs, such as `ssh'/`scp'.

A remote file name has always the syntax

  /method:user%domain@host#port:/path/to/file

Most of the parts are optional, read the manual for details.
