Parameters:
  file - Absolute path to Org file (string, required)
  headline_path - Non-empty slash-separated path to headline (string,

                  Example: \"Project/Planning\" for nested headlines
                  Example: \"A%2FB Testing\" for headline titled

Returns: JSON object with structure:

   "Access content of a specific Org headline by its path in the
file hierarchy.  Returns the headline and all its subheadings as
plain text.

URI format: org-headline://{filename}#{headline-path}
  filename - Absolute path (# characters must be encoded as %23)
  # - Fragment separator (literal #, not encoded)
  headline-path - URL-encoded headline titles separated by /

URI encoding rules:
  - File path # → %23 (e.g., file#1.org → file%231.org)
  - Fragment separator → # (literal, marks start of headline path)
  - Headline title spaces → %20
  - Headline title # → %23 (e.g., Task #5 → Task%20%2345)
  - Path separator → / (literal, between nested headlines)

Encoding limitations:
  - ONLY # is encoded in file paths (minimal encoding for readability)
  - File paths with % characters should be avoided
  - Files named with %XX patterns (e.g., \"100%23done.org\") will fail
  - For such files, rename them or use org-id:// URIs instead
  - Headline paths use full URL encoding (all special chars encoded)

Returns: Plain text content including:
  - The headline itself with TODO state and tags
  - All properties drawer content
  - Body text
  - All nested subheadings (complete subtree)

Example URIs:
  org-headline:///home/user/tasks.org#Project%20Alpha
    → Top-level \"Project Alpha\" heading

  org-headline:///home/user/tasks.org#Project%20Alpha/Planning
    → \"Planning\" subheading under \"Project Alpha\"

  org-headline:///home/user/tasks.org#Issue%20%2342
    → Heading titled \"Issue #42\"

  org-headline:///home/user/file%231.org#Task%20%235
    → \"Task #5\" from file named \"file#1.org\"

  org-headline:///home/user/tasks.org

   "Access content of an Org headline by its unique ID property.
More stable than path-based access since IDs don't change when
headlines are renamed or moved.

URI format: org-id://{uuid}
  uuid - Value of the headline's ID property (required)

How IDs work in Org:
  Headlines can have an ID property:
    * My Headline
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
    :END:

  The ID provides permanent, unique identification regardless of:
    - Headline title changes
    - Headline moving to different locations in file
    - File renaming or moving

Security and access:
  - The file containing the ID must be in org-mcp-allowed-files
  - Uses org-id database for ID-to-file lookup
  - Falls back to searching allowed files if database is stale

Returns: Plain text content including:
  - The headline itself with TODO state and tags
  - All properties drawer content
  - Body text
  - All nested subheadings (complete subtree)

Example URIs:
  org-id://550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
    → Headline with that ID property

Use this resource to:
  - Access headlines by stable identifier
  - Reference content that may be renamed or moved
  - Build cross-references between Org nodes"
