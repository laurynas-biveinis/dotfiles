(autoload 'difftastic-git-diff-range "difftastic" "\
Show difference between two commits using difftastic.
The meaning of REV-OR-RANGE, ARGS, and FILES is like in
`magit-diff-range', but ARGS are adjusted for difftastic with
`difftastic--transform-diff-arguments'.

(fn &optional REV-OR-RANGE ARGS FILES)" t)
(autoload 'difftastic-magit-diff "difftastic" "\
Show the result of \\='git diff ARGS -- FILES\\=' with difftastic.

(fn &optional ARGS FILES)" t)
(autoload 'difftastic-magit-show "difftastic" "\
Show the result of \\='git show REV\\=' with difftastic.
When REV couldn't be guessed or called with prefix arg ask for REV.

(fn REV)" t)
(autoload 'difftastic-buffers "difftastic" "\
Run difftastic on a pair of buffers, BUFFER-A and BUFFER-B.
Optionally, provide a LANG-OVERRIDE to override language used.
See \\='difft --list-languages\\=' for language list.

When:
- either LANG-OVERRIDE is nil and neither of BUFFER-A nor
BUFFER-B is a file buffer,
- or function is called with a prefix arg,

then ask for language before running difftastic.

(fn BUFFER-A BUFFER-B &optional LANG-OVERRIDE)" t)
(autoload 'difftastic-files "difftastic" "\
Run difftastic on a pair of files, FILE-A and FILE-B.
Optionally, provide a LANG-OVERRIDE to override language used.
See \\='difft --list-languages\\=' for language list.  When
function is called with a prefix arg then ask for language before
running difftastic.

(fn FILE-A FILE-B &optional LANG-OVERRIDE)" t)
(autoload 'difftastic-dired-diff "difftastic" "\
Compare file at point with FILE using difftastic.

The behavior is the same as `dired-diff', except for the prefix argument, which
makes the function prompt for LANG-OVERRIDE.  See \\='difft
--list-languages\\=' for language list.

(fn FILE &optional LANG-OVERRIDE)" '(dired-mode))
(autoload 'difftastic-rerun "difftastic" "\
Rerun difftastic in the current buffer.
Optionally, provide a LANG-OVERRIDE to override language used.
See \\='difft --list-languages\\=' for language list.  When
function is called with a prefix arg then ask for language before
running difftastic.

In order to determine requested width for difftastic a call to
`difftastic-rerun-requested-window-width-function' is made.  When
the latter is set to nil the call is made to
`difftastic-requested-window-width-function'.
