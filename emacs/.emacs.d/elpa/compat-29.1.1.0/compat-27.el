  "Search for the next region of text where PREDICATE is true.
PREDICATE is used to decide whether a value of PROPERTY should be
considered as matching VALUE.

If PREDICATE is a function, it will be called with two arguments:
VALUE and the value of PROPERTY.  The function should return
non-nil if these two values are to be considered a match.

Two special values of PREDICATE can also be used:
If PREDICATE is t, that means a value must `equal' VALUE to be
considered a match.
If PREDICATE is nil (which is the default value), a value will
match if is not `equal' to VALUE.  Furthermore, a nil PREDICATE
means that the match region is ended if the value changes.  For
instance, this means that if you loop with

  (while (setq prop (text-property-search-forward \\='face))
    ...)

you will get all distinct regions with non-nil `face' values in
the buffer, and the `prop' object will have the details about the
match.  See the manual for more details and examples about how
VALUE and PREDICATE interact.

If NOT-CURRENT is non-nil, the function will search for the first
region that doesn't include point and has a value of PROPERTY
that matches VALUE.

If no matches can be found, return nil and don't move point.
If found, move point to the end of the region and return a
`prop-match' object describing the match.  To access the details
of the match, use `prop-match-beginning' and `prop-match-end' for
the buffer positions that limit the region, and
`prop-match-value' for the value of PROPERTY in the region."
