;;; Commentary:

;; wgrep-deadgrep allows you to edit a deadgrep buffer and apply those changes to
;; the file buffer.

;;; Install:

;; 1. Install deadgrep.el
;;
;;   https://github.com/Wilfred/deadgrep

;; 2. Install wgrep.el

;; 3. Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (autoload 'wgrep-deadgrep-setup "wgrep-deadgrep")
;;     (add-hook 'deadgrep-finished-hook 'wgrep-deadgrep-setup)

;;; Usage:

;; See wgrep.el

;;; Code:

(require 'wgrep)

(defun wgrep-deadgrep-prepare-header&footer ()
  "Prepare header in `deadgrep' buffer for `wgrep'.
Since `deadgrep' does not have footer, only header is handled."
  ;; `deadgrep' uses "deadgrep-filename" property for filename.
  (let ((pos (next-single-property-change (point-min) 'deadgrep-filename)))
    (if pos
        (add-text-properties (point-min) pos '(read-only t wgrep-header t))
      (add-text-properties (point-min) (point-max)
                           '(read-only t wgrep-header t)))))

(defun wgrep-deadgrep-parse-command-results ()
  "Parse `deadgrep' results for `wgrep'."
  ;; Note that this function is called with the buffer narrowed to
  ;; exclude the header and the footer.  (We're going to assert that
  ;; fact here, because we use (bobp) result a bit further down to
  ;; decide that we're not reading grouped results; see below.)

            ;; Ignore the line that introduces matches from a file, so that
            ;; wgrep doesn't let you edit it.
