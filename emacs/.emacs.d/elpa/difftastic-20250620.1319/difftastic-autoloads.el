Define `difftastic' bindings.
This variable defines all bindings together with prefixes and keymaps
where they should be installed.  It is an alist where each entry in in a
form (SPECS . BINDINGS).  The SPECS is an alist where each entry is in a
form (TYPE . SPEC).  The TYPE is either `prefixes' or `keymaps' and:

- When TYPE is `prefixes' then SPEC is a list where each element is in a
  from of (PREFIX LOC FEATURE), where PREFIX is a `transient' prefix to
  which to install bindings, LOC is a location within the prefix and
  FEATURE is a feature (symbol) or file (string) that defines the
  prefix.  When length of SPEC is equal to 1 the binding is installed a
  transient suffix, otherwise it's installed as a transient column.  LOC
  can be in any form accepted by `transient-get-suffix', which see.

- When TYPE is `keymaps' then SPEC is a list where each element is in a
  form of (MAP . FEATURE), where MAP is a keymap to set bindings to and
  FEATURE is a feature (symbol) or file (string) that defines the MAP.

BINDINGS is a list where each enlement is in a form of (KEY COMMAND
DESCRIPTION), where KEY is a key that should be bound, COMMAND is a
command that should be executed when KEY has been pressed, and
DESCRIPTION is a description that should be used for suffixes that are
added to prefixes.  KEY needs to be a valid key according to
`key-valid-p' and in a form accepted by `transient-append-suffix'.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Difftastic-Bindings mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is
positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable
the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='difftastic-bindings-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
