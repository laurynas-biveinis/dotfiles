* v0.8.1 (2024-10-19)

- Guard against unspecified ~default~ (backup) face foreground/background colors, as on TTY with ~tty-color-mode=no~.

- =BUGFIX= Guard against custom-set errors when tree-sitter is enabled, but no scope stanza is present for the buffer's language.
- Make ~indent-bars-no-descend-lists=nil~ by default (to avoid confusion in brace and paren languages).
- Allow ~indent-bars-no-descend-string=all~ to inhibit /all/ bars inside multi-line strings.
- =BUGFIX= Use correct offset guess when derived from ~python-base-mode~.
- Be more careful when replacing/restoring ~font-lock-fontify-region-function~.
