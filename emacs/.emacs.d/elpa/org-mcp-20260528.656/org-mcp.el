RESPONSE-ALIST is an alist of response fields appended to the JSON

Macro behaviour:
- Validates FILE-PATH has no unsaved changes (errors via
  `org-mcp--fail-if-modified' if so).
- Sets up a temp buffer with FILE-PATH's contents in `org-mode',
  with `set-visited-file-name' pointing at FILE-PATH and point at
  `point-min'.
- Executes BODY in that buffer.
- After BODY returns, calls `org-mcp--complete-and-save' which
  ensures the entry containing point has an Org ID (creating one
  if needed), writes the buffer to FILE-PATH, refreshes any
  visiting Emacs buffer, and returns JSON with the entry's
  `org-id://' URI.

BODY contract:
- May access FILE-PATH, OPERATION, and RESPONSE-ALIST as
  variables.
- Must NOT call `org-mcp--complete-and-save' itself; the macro
  appends it after BODY.  Calling it inside BODY would write the
  file twice and return a stale JSON shape.
- Must leave point at or within the entry whose `org-id://' URI
  should be returned to the caller.
- BODY's return value is discarded; the macro's return value is
  the JSON from `org-mcp--complete-and-save'.
- Errors signalled in BODY propagate up unmodified (no rollback)."

  `:disallowed' ID found but the resolved file is not in the
                allowed list.
  `:missing'    ID not found in `org-id-locations' nor in any
                allowed file.
FILE is meaningful only for `:found' (the expanded path).  For
`:disallowed' and `:missing' FILE is nil; the resolved-but-
unauthorised path is intentionally not carried in the result so
callers cannot inadvertently leak file locations outside
`org-mcp-allowed-files' through error messages.

First consults `org-id-find-id-file'; if that misses, falls back
to scanning every entry in `org-mcp-allowed-files' for an `:ID:'
property matching ID.  On a successful fallback the resolved
\(id, file) pair is registered into `org-id-locations' so subsequent
lookups for the same ID hit the DB at O(1) instead of re-scanning;
this cache write is gated on `org-id-track-globally', so users who
have explicitly opted out of global ID tracking do not get implicit
DB mutations.  The cache write is performed best-effort -- any
signal from `org-id-add-location' is swallowed so a write failure
cannot poison a successful resolution.

Callers translate the status into a tool error or a resource error
of the appropriate shape."

    headline.

  Child, start.
    Inputs: parent_uri + position=\"start\"; no after_uri.
    Effect: inserted as the first child of the parent, after the
    parent's property drawer, planning line, logbook entries, and
    plain-text body -- i.e. just before the parent's first
    existing child heading.  When the parent has no children,
    `start' collapses to `end' at end-of-subtree.

  Top-level, end (default).
    Inputs: parent_uri with no fragment; no after_uri; position
    omitted or \"end\".
    Effect: appended at end of file.

  Top-level, start.
    Inputs: parent_uri (no fragment) + position=\"start\"; no
    after_uri.
    Effect: inserted before the first existing top-level heading
    but after the file's entire header block.  The header block
    is every leading line starting with `#' (including
    #+-prefixed keywords like #+TITLE:, file-local variable lines
    like `# -*- mode: org -*-', and Org comment lines), plus any
    :NAME:...:END: drawer in the leading run (:PROPERTIES:,
    :LOGBOOK:, and any custom drawer keyword are all consumed
    uniformly, even when Org's grammar would classify the drawer
    as a generic drawer rather than a file-level property drawer,
    to avoid silently reparenting it onto the new heading).  All
    header-class lines may have optional leading whitespace,
    matching Org's parser; headings themselves still require
    column 0.  When the file has no existing top-level heading
    (empty file, header-only, or zeroth-section content like a
    plain paragraph after the header), `start' collapses to `end'
    at point-max rather than inserting after the header block.
    This preserves any zeroth-section content in place instead of
    absorbing it into the new heading's body.

Combinations outside these five are rejected at the tool boundary.
After_uri cannot combine with an explicit position (which includes
position=\"end\", even though that is the default -- omit position
entirely to use after_uri-based placement), nor with a top-level
parent_uri (which has no sibling slot)."

URI format: org-headline://{filename}#{headline-path}
  filename - Absolute path (# characters must be encoded as %23)
  # - Fragment separator (literal #, not encoded)
  headline-path - URL-encoded headline titles separated by /

URI encoding rules:

  - Fragment separator → # (literal, marks start of headline path)
  - Headline title spaces → %20
  - Headline title # → %23 (e.g., Task #5 → Task%20%2345)
  - Path separator → / (literal, between nested headlines)

Encoding limitations:
  - ONLY # is encoded in file paths (minimal encoding for readability)
  - File paths with % characters should be avoided
  - Files named with %XX patterns (e.g., \"100%23done.org\") will fail
  - For such files, rename them or use org-id:// URIs instead
  - Headline paths use full URL encoding (all special chars encoded)

Returns: Plain text content including:

More stable than path-based access since IDs don't change when

URI format: org-id://{uuid}
  uuid - Value of the headline's ID property (required)

How IDs work in Org:
  Headlines can have an ID property:

    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

  The ID provides permanent, unique identification regardless of:
    - Headline title changes
    - Headline moving to different locations in file
    - File renaming or moving

Security and access:
  - The file containing the ID must be in org-mcp-allowed-files
  - Uses org-id database for ID-to-file lookup
  - Falls back to searching allowed files if database is stale

Returns: Plain text content including:
  - The headline itself with TODO state and tags
