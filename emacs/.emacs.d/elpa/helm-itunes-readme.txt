A search & play interface for iTunes and Spotify.

You can search for either a song, artist, or album.

Bugs:
- Symbols in song titles will sometimes prevent the song from playing
in iTunes. Tracks are "percent-encoded" when played through Spotify,
so they do not have this problem.
- iTunes will open and close various times upon a search.

Currently only supports OS X.
