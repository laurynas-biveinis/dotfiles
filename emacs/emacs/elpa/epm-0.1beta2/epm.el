;;; Commentary:

;; epm is a command-line wrapper for `package.el' that let you manage
;; Emacs packages from command-line
;;
;; After installing epm from Melpa or Melpa-stable, alias
;; `/path/to/epm/epm` as `epm`
;;
;;   $ alias epm='~/.emacs.d/elpa/epm-*/epm'
;;
;; Assuming the value of your `package-user-dir' is "~/.emacs.d/elpa"
;;
;; To use, invoke `epm' from shell
;;
;;   $ epm --help
;;
;; See the accompanying README.md for details.
