;;; Commentary:

;; This package watches the current display geometry (pixel width and height) and gives your
;; hook a call if it changes.  Intended use case is plugging/unplugging a monitor.
;;
;; Usage
;;
;; Require or use-package this.  Make a hook function which takes one argument, a pair of
;; pixel width and height, like `(1024 . 768)`, then add your hook to
;; `dispwatch-display-change-hooks`.  You will get called when that changes, eg by removing
;; or adding a monitor.  Then call `(dispwatch-mode 1)` to get started and `(dispwatch-mode -1)`
;; to stop.  `(dispwatch-mode)` toggles.
;; 
;; Example
;; 
;;  (defun my-display-changed-hook (disp)
;;    (message "rejiggering for %s" disp)
;;    (cond ((equal disp '(3840 . 1080))   ; laptop + ext monitor
;;           (setq font-size-pt 10))
;;          ((equal disp '(1920 . 1080))    ; just laptop
;;           (setq font-size-pt 11))
;;          (t (message "Unknown display size %sx%s" (car disp) (cdr disp)))))
;;
;;   (use-package dispwatch
;;     :config (and
;;        (add-hook 'dispwatch-display-change-hooks #'my-display-changed-hook)
