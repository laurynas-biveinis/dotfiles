This package provides a Helm interface to major and minor mode
information.  It is intended as a replacement for `describe-mode',
`describe-minor-mode', and other related commands.

This package is heavily inspired by the `helm-descbinds' package by
Taiki Sugawara.  See: https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-descbinds
